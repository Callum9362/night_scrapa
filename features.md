### 
1. **Scrape Additional Information**:
    - ~~Add more details for each country (e.g., population, GDP, area, official languages).~~
    ~~- User agent applied to requests to meet requirements.~~
    - Support scraping from multiple sources for better accuracy and redundancy.

2. **Scheduled Scraping (Cron Jobs)**:
    - Automatically scrape data periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) using a tool like `tokio`'s **cron-like scheduling libraries**.

3. **Handle Pagination**:
    - Support scraping websites that display data across multiple pages.

4. **Dynamic Content Scraping**:
    - Handle JavaScript-rendered content using a tool like `headless_chrome` or `puppeteer`.

### **Database and Data Management**
1. **Duplicate Management**:
    - Build better duplicate-detection mechanisms and log duplicates for manual review.

2. **Historical Data Tracking**:
    - Track changes in scraped data over time by storing older versions of records. For example:
        - Store timestamps to know when each record was last updated.
        - Build a feature to compare historical data to detect changes like updates to country populations.

3. **Data Validation**:
    - Implement rule-based or AI-assisted data validation to detect and reject incorrect/invalid data during or after scraping.

4. **Export Data**:
    - Allow exporting the scraped data in formats like:
        - JSON
        - CSV
        - XML

### **Performance Features**
1. **Parallel Scraping**:
    - Speed up the scraping process by implementing asynchronous or multi-threaded scraping for multiple pages in parallel.

2. **Rate Limiting**:
~~3. Avoid being blocked by websites by adhering to rate limits (e.g., delay between requests, maximum requests per second).~~
4. **Load Balancing for Proxies**:
5. Add support for rotating proxies to scrape data anonymously and efficiently.

### **Error Handling and Logging**
1. **Better Error Handling**:
    - Gracefully handle network errors, timeouts, or changes to the website's structure.

2. **Detailed Logging**:
    - Add structured logs for debugging and monitoring:
        - Save logs to files (e.g., using `tracing` / `env_logger` crate).
        - Include success/failure rates or reasons for errors.

### **Visualization and Analytics**
1. **Data Dashboards**:
    - Create a front-end web interface or API to visualize the scraped data (e.g., interactive charts/maps of country data).

2. **Filter and Sort**:
    - Implement filters to sort or query countries by criteria like name, population, GDP, etc.

3. **Change Notifications**:
    - Notify users (via email, webhook, etc.) when any significant change is detected in the scraped data.

### **Testing and Debugging**
1. **Mock Scraping Environment**:
    - Create a mock website for reliable testing of the scraper without relying on live data.

2. **Unit Tests for Parsing**:
    - Write focused tests to verify if the scraper extracts data correctly from HTML (e.g., `scraper` crate results).

3. **Performance Benchmarks**:
    - Measure scraping performance (e.g., time taken to scrape 250 countries) and optimize slow areas.

### **User Interaction Features**
1. **CLI Interface**:
    - Add a command-line interface for users to:
        - Start the scraper manually.
        - Specify custom input parameters like region (e.g., only scrape Europe).
        - Export data on demand.

2. **Web API**:
    - Build a RESTful API around the data for external integration. For example:
        - `/countries`
        - `/countries/{name}`
        - Filters like `/countries?min_population=10000000`

### **Scraping Adaptability**
1. **Dynamic Selector Updates**:
    - Automatically detect changes in the website's structure (e.g., HTML class changes) and adjust selectors dynamically.

2. **Multi-language Support**:
    - Scrape websites that present data in different languages or formats.

3. **Multi-Site Integration**:
    - Support scraping similar data from multiple sites to enrich information or improve resilience by cross-checking sources.

### **Scaling and Deployment**
1. **Dockerize the Application**:
    - Containerize the scraper for reproducible builds, easier deployment, and CI/CD pipelines.
